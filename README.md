## RP2040 Scripts

### WORKING 
This is the original script I used. The only reason it is here is so I can copy code over to other scripts.

### Bare
A Bare script that showcases LittleFS. Can be used on "any" RP2040 board.

### Send
This script shows you how to send data over serial.

### Tree
This script is a wonderful debugging tool, lists every directory, every file, located on the file system. 


## Python Scripts

### Read
This is the other side of the Send RP2040 script. Asks for data then writes it to a file.
